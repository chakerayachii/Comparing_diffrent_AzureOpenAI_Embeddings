# Comparison of Azure OpenAI Embeddings

## Overview

This document provides guidelines and procedures for comparing different Azure OpenAI embeddings. The goal is to evaluate the performance and applicability of various embedding models provided by Azure OpenAI, focusing on aspects such as accuracy, dimensionality, and computational efficiency.

## Prerequisites

- Access to Azure OpenAI services.
- Azure subscription and API key.
- Python environment with necessary packages (`azure-ai-openai`, `scikit-learn`, etc.) installed.

## Available Embeddings

Azure OpenAI offers a variety of embeddings, each suited for different types of tasks. Some of the common embeddings include:

- Text Embeddings : ada / large / small

## Comparison Criteria

1. **Dimensionality** : Compare the dimensions of the embeddings and how they affect the performance.
2. **Compute Efficiency** : Evaluate the time and resources required to generate embeddings.
3. **Use Case Suitability** : Assess which embeddings are best suited for specific tasks

## Evaluation Methods

- Use cosine similarity to compare the similarity between different embeddings.

## Reporting Results

- Compile the results in a structured format.
- Include visual representations (graphs) to illustrate the comparisons.

## Conclusion

Summarize the findings and provide recommendations based on the comparison of different Azure OpenAI embeddings
